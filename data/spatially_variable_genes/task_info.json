  "taskSummary": "Spatially variable genes (SVGs) are genes whose expression levels vary significantly across different spatial regions within a tissue or across cells in a spatially structured context.",
  "taskDescription": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in spatially-resolved transcriptome profiling techniques that simultaneously characterize cellular gene expression and their physical position, generating spatial transcriptomic (ST) data. The application of these techniques has dramatically advanced our understanding of disease and developmental biology. One common task for all ST profiles, regardless of the employed protocols, is to identify genes that exhibit spatial patterns. These genes, defined as spatially variable genes (SVGs), contain additional information about the spatial structure of the tissues of interest, compared to highly variable genes (HVGs).\n\nIdentification of spatially variable genes is crucial to for studying spatial domains within tissue microenvironmnets, developmental gradients and cell signaling pathways. In this task we attempt to evaluate various methods for detecting SVGs using a number of realistic simulated datasets with diverse patterns derived from real-world spatial transcriptomics data using scDesign3. Synthetic data is generated by mixing a Gaussian Process (GP) model and a non-spatial model (obtained by shuffling mean parameters of the GP model to remove spatial correlation between spots) to generate gene expressions with various spatial variability.
