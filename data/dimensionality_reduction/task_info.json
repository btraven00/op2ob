  "taskDescription": "\nDimensionality reduction is one of the key challenges in single-cell data\nrepresentation. Routine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments measure cells\nin roughly 20,000-30,000 dimensions (i.e., features - mostly gene transcripts but also\nother functional elements encoded in mRNA such as lncRNAs). Since its inception,\nscRNA-seq experiments have been growing in terms of the number of cells measured.\nOriginally, cutting-edge SmartSeq experiments would yield a few hundred cells, at best.\nNow, it is not uncommon to see experiments that yield over [100,000\ncells](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#tabula2018single) or even [> 1 million\ncells.](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#cao2020human)\n\nEach *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000\ndimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall\nstructure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity\nand the [*\\"
